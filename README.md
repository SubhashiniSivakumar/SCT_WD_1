Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item.  The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages.

This project is my first task at Skill Craft Technology, where I built an interactive and responsive navigation menu. The menu is designed to improve the user experience with features like hover effects, a dynamic background color that changes when scrolling, and a fixed position to ensure consistent visibility across all pagesThis task helped me understand dynamic DOM manipulation, responsive design techniques, and creating interactive web interfaces for enhanced usability.
